# Responsive-Portfolio

This is a portfolio of my work I initially created as an experiment in responsive css, but I now maintain it as a showcase for my projects.

## Website Organization
The website is made up of two pages.

1. **The Landing Page:** The landing page features a quick bio of me, my contact information, as well as links to my GitHub profile and LinkedIn pages.

2. **The Portfolio Page:** This page offers a collection of projects I've worked on with links to those projects.

## Responsive Design
With both pages, the design of the change will alter depending on the size of the user's screen.
